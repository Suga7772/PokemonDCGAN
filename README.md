<h1 align="center">Pok√©mon DCGAN Model üé®‚ö°</h1>

Welcome to the Pok√©mon DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) repository! This project showcases a generative model trained to create new, unique Pok√©mon-like images using a DCGAN architecture. The model was trained on a dataset of over 29,000 Pok√©mon images and deployed via Streamlit for real-time image generation. Dive into the world of new generated Pok√©mons and create new imposters to life!

<h2>üåü Introduction</h2>
This project explores the capabilities of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic images of Pok√©mon faces that do not exist in the original dataset. The model leverages a DCGAN architecture and was trained for 450 epochs on a curated dataset of Pok√©mon images. The final model was deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to interactively generate and explore new Pok√©mon faces.

<h2>üìä Dataset</h2>
The model was trained on a combination of two datasets:
<h3> Pokemon_V2 Dataset (Kaggle) </h3>

- 9,002 images from the Kaggle hub dataset.

- Link: [Pokemon_V2 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajatvisitme/pokemon-image-dataset-v2)
<h3>Pokemon Generation One (Kaggle)</h3>

- 20,100 images of Generation 1 Pok√©mon.

- Link: .[Pokemon Gen 1 22000](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhawks/pokemon-generation-one-22k)
  
<h2> üõ† Methodology </h2>

<p>The model uses a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial (Neural) Network architecture with the following components:</p>

<h3>Generator</h3> 

- Input: 128-dimensional noise vector.

- Final layer: Conv2DTranspose with 3 filters and tanh activation (output: 64x64x3 image).
  
<h3>Discriminator</h3>

- Input: 64x64x3 RGB image.
  
<h4>Layers:</h4>
