<h1 align="center">Pokémon DCGAN Model 🎨⚡</h1>

Welcome to the Pokémon DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) repository! This project showcases a generative model trained to create new, unique Pokémon-like images using a DCGAN architecture. The model was trained on a dataset of over 29,000 Pokémon images and deployed via Streamlit for real-time image generation. Dive into the world of AI-generated Pokémon and explore how deep learning can bring fictional creatures to life!

<h2>🌟 Introduction</h2>
This project explores the capabilities of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic images of Pokémon faces that do not exist in the original dataset. The model leverages a DCGAN architecture and was trained for 450 epochs on a curated dataset of Pokémon images. The final model was deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to interactively generate and explore new Pokémon faces.

<h2>📊 Dataset</h2>
The model was trained on a combination of two datasets:
<h3> Pokemon_V2 Dataset (Kaggle) </h3>

- 9,002 images from the Kaggle hub dataset.

- Link: [Pokemon_V2 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajatvisitme/pokemon-image-dataset-v2)
<h3>Pokemon Generation One (Kaggle)</h3>

- 20,100 images of Generation 1 Pokémon.

- Link: .[Pokemon Gen 1 22000](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhawks/pokemon-generation-one-22k)
  
<h2> 🛠 Methodology </h2>

<p>The model uses a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial (Neural) Network architecture with the following components:</p>

<h3>Generator</h3> 

- Input: 128-dimensional noise vector.
  
<h4>Layers:</h4>

- Dense layer → Reshape → 4 Transposed Convolutional Blocks (Conv2DTranspose → BatchNorm → ReLU). 

- Final layer: Conv2DTranspose with 3 filters and tanh activation (output: 64x64x3 image).
  
<h3>Discriminator</h3>

- Input: 64x64x3 RGB image.
  
<h4>Layers:</h4>

- 5 Convolutional Blocks (Conv2D → BatchNorm → LeakyReLU).

- Final layer: Dense layer with sigmoid activation (real/fake classification).

<h4>Training</h4>

- Epochs: 450
  
<h5>
- Technology Used: TensorFlow, PyTorch (for pGAN)
- Hardware: Google Colab and kaggle notebook P100 GPU
 </h5>
